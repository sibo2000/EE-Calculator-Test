### About my implementation
* Ability run operands on two values of any size eg 5 + 5, or 100 x 100.
* Used create react app for quick set up.
* Simple state management to save time writing redux boilerplate.
* Focused on creating good UI with modern CSS, no need for Bootstrap/Foundation.
* Pushed to AWS using Amplify.

### Improvements
* Ability to run multiple computations eg (5 + 5 + 5).
* Ability to run further computations after hittin =.
* Seperate out the calculator in smaller components.
